Once upon a time, there was man named Collin who went to school at UW-Madison.
He was studying really hard for his physics exam, but wans't super confident
that he really knew the material. I guess we'll find out tonight.  

After that fateful night of Physics he felt defeated. The test was incredibly
difficult, and when he got home he plopped on the couch. His house was quiet, 
none of his roommates were home they had all gone out. He thought that catching up
with his roommates would take his mind off the fact he just failed so he threw his
backpack in his room and left once again.

While Collin was taking a walk outside, he runs into his roommates. He immediately
expresses to them how hard the week has been, how much he studied for the exam, and
how he might've bombed the exam anyway. His roommates listened patiently, then they
all decided that they will bring Collin out. So they took him home, got him changed,
and all went out and had a good time.
