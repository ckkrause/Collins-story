Once upon a time, there was man named Collin who went to school at UW-Madison.
He was studying really hard for his physics exam, but wans't super confident
that he really knew the material. I guess we'll find out tonight.  

After that fateful night of Physics he felt defeated. The test was incredibly
difficult, and when he got home he plopped on the couch. His house was quiet, 
none of his roommates were home they had all gone out. He thought that catching up
with his roommates would take his mind off the fact he just failed so he threw his
backpack in his room and left once again.
